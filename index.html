    <h1>Grawlix</h1>
    <p>
      Grawlix lets you comment on Haskell documentation. It's still alpha
      quality, but it works. Read more about the project
      <a href="https://github.com/tfausak/grawlix">on GitHub</a>. Here's how to
      use it:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Get <a href="/client">the client</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select everything (<code>Ctrl + A</code>) and copy it
        (<code>Ctrl + C</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to some Haskell documentation on Hackage or Stackage. For example,
        <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/salve-0.0.8/docs/Salve.html">Salve</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the developer console (<code>Ctrl + Shift + I</code>). This has
        only been tested on Windows so far.
      </li>
      <li>
        Paste all the code from the client (<code>Ctrl + V</code>) and run it
        (<code>Enter</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The comment sections should load in. Pretty much nothing will have any
        comments yet.

      </li>
      <li>
        Type in a comment and click "Submit". You'll bounce through some
        redirects, including GitHub's OAuth. You should end up back on the page
        you were on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Re-open the developer console, re-paste the JavaScript, and re-run it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your comment should show up. Hooray!
